# Biography

I am a MSc Candidate in Applied Science at Saint Mary's Univeristy (Halifax, Canada). Currently, my narrow academic interests are in: (1) applying different ecological concepts (e.g., traits, phylogenetics) to help design multifunctional green roof ecosystems, and (2) understanding how changes in the urban landscape alters wild bee communities. 

In addition, I love to integrate the R programming language into my research routine. For example, this very website was built using the fantastic "blogdown" R package with the help of Hugo and Netlify! In the near future, I plan to provide a fully reproducible workflow for future research projects. 

Outside of academia, I dabble in calisthenics, finding new hip-hop albums, and cooking vegan dishes.
