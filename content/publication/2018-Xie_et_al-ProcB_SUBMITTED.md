abstract = "Wild bees support critical pollination services, but urbanization could result in cities having non-random subsets of closely related species that share similar functional traits. Understanding diversity patterns across urban landscapes might shed light on community assembly and help maintain biodiversity and ecosystem services in cities. Here, we sample cavity-nesting bee diversity using trap nests from 200 sites across an urbanization gradient, reconstruct phylogenetic relationships, and estimate trait-based similarities using six bee functional traits relevant to bee life history, foraging, and nesting activity. We formally test for environmental filtering and find contrasting patterns: species richness is filtered by habitat heterogeneity and functional diversity (specifically, nesting material use) by urbanization, but environmental filtering did not shape the phylogenetic structure of bee communities, independent of local processes. Our study emphasizes that phylogenetic and functional approaches, compared to species richness, offer new insight into the relationship between urbanization and biodiversity."
